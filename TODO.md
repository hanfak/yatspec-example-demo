- Create Yatspec test (X)
- Use givens builder (X)
- use YatspecTest from clean arch mattia,
    - generic and,with etc
- Use yatspec log, instead of captured inputs and outputs for yatspec output (X)
- Use and assert on captured inputs and outputs
    - app req & resp (X)
    - multiple req & resp (ext and int)
    - for db
    - for logs
    - for objects
- Sequence diagrams
    - external calls (X)
    - now internal calls
    - multiple internal calls
- use interesting givens, and get type see   AppointmentReservationLookupResourceReturnsReservationTest - clyde
    - getType form captured inputs andoutputs to assert on, use when with this lambda (X)
    - addToGivens wrappers see AbstractTestCase in clyde (X)
    - Use givens.gettype, from one given in another given (X)
    - builder pattern see GivenButtersReturnsAddress in clyde (x)
    - compositeGivens see clyde (x)

- assert on request and response
    - using fields (X)

- assert on logs
- assert on what is in the database
- example of using a fluent api (codac)
- hamcrest using state extractor (X)
- assertj using state extractor (X)
- failsafe, artifact locations (X)
- table tests
    - common
    - custom
- wiremock and/or jzonbie
- show wiremock primings
- Dsl for fluent assertions, whens and givens
- Notes
- linking notes
- dictionary
- html ouput index page
- Have tests run when docker is running ie build
- New project
